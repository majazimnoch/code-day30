# QR Code Generator
## Intro
This is the final project of my 30-day coding challenge. Project includes following tech stuff: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API.

## Idea
I spotted this idea at someone's elses portfolio and I thought it will be  fun and practical assignment. I am sure I will be using it myself a lot. 

## Breaking down the code
It's actually a very easy project, which requires fetching from a public API. It's just a little bit of JS so I coded JS in HTML file, under script tag.
